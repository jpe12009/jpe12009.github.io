				<h3> Objective: Reduce your opponent's life to 0 </h3>

			<h3> ------------------ Round structure ------------------- </h3>
				<br>
			<ul>
				<li> 1. Buy units at the market. You are given gold at the start of each round. </li>
				<br>
				<li> 2. You attack first. Battle begins with the first unit you purchased. </li>
				<br>
				<li> 3. Your unit continues attacking until either it misses, the defending unit survives the attack, or when no enemies remain. </li>
				<br>
				<li> 4. If the round is not over, the enemy attacks in the same manner. </li>
				<br>
				<li> 5. Whoever destroys their opponent's army for the round is the round winner! </li>
				<br>
				<li> 6. The victor deals damage to the opposing castle equal to the sum of their units' attack stat. </li>
				<br>
				<li> 7. The game board is cleared and then the enemy repopulates the game board with a stronger army. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Familiarize yourself with the enemy's forces so you can purchase units accordingly at the start of a new round. 
				<br>
				<span id = 'shrink' > Or you can just click a bunch and hope for the best. </span></li>
				<br>
				<li> Have fun! </li>
				<br>
				After clicking the button below follow the instructions in the white box to build your army.
